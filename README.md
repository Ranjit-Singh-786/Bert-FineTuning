### Fine-tuning BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) To perform Text-classification<br>

<p>In this repository, i fine tune Bert model on a custome dataset. to solve multiclass classification, and Each and every lines of code written in understable and readable format with comments, so if you want unlock the power of LLM, try all these steps to solve your multiclass classification problem with good accuracy.<br>

### Steps of this project

<ul>
<li>Get The Dataset.</li>
<li>Process The Data.</li>
<li>Load the Bert Pre-Trained model and its Tokenizer.</li>
<li>Re-Train The Pre-Trained model on our custome Dataset </li>
<li>Model Evaluation.</li>
<li>Get The Prediction on Test Data Point.</li>
<li>Finally Save The Fine-Tuned Model.</li>
</ul>
